For the TE Connectivy Classifier

In the same folder where you have the python running, you must create those folders or it won't work

opencv-python is required

When you run it, the first image in the input folder will pop out, and you can go to the next image with e, or to the previous one with q

To save the image shown in folder 1, click 1 on the keyboard

2 for 2, 3 for 3, and 4 for OK

In the shell, they will get "True" if the image was saved and "False" if not, as well as the category to which they tried to send it

Ignore the red rectangle, it won't do anything, it will still copy the entire image to the folder you want

And remember that the display of the image must be the "active window" to save the image, if it does not do something, click on it and that's it

Types of errors:

1.Insufficient Solder
2. Surplus Solder
3. Union Solder
